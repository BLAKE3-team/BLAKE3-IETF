Hello,

Please find attached updated "final" draft-saarinen-blake2-06.xml, as
requested, and the corresponding txt file.

Changes from original I-D draft-saarinen-blake2-06.xml to this version:

- Trimmed extra spaces at the end of line and empty lines from tables (global).

- Appendix A: The internal variable contents are now aligned with the
right border.

- Appendix A and B: Wording changed from ".. and display internal
values of computation" to ".. and show internal values during
computation".

- Appendix E: "This is fairly a exhaustive.." corrected to "This is a
fairly exhaustive..".

- Affiliation of editor slightly modified (changed my e-mail address
and web site to official work addresses).

Cheers,
- markku

Dr. Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen <mjos@iki.fi>
